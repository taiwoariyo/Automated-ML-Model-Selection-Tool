# Automated-ML-Model-Selection-Tool
A Streamlit-based app that automates the selection, training, and tuning of machine learning models for classification and regression tasks. Upload datasets, evaluate models, visualize performance, and fine-tune hyperparametersâ€”all with an easy-to-use interface.
Building an Automated ML Model Selection Tool.
