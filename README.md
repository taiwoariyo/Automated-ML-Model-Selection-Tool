# Automated-ML-Model-Selection-Tool
A Streamlit-based app that automates the selection, training, and tuning of machine learning models for classification and regression tasks. Upload datasets, evaluate models, visualize performance, and fine-tune hyperparametersâ€”all with an easy-to-use interface.



STEP 1: DEFINE PROJECT SCOPE


PURPOSE: Select the best-performing machine learning tool based on a given data set.

CRITERIA: Accuracy, Performance, Precision, recall, F1 score.

INPUT: Dataset (CSV, Database)

OUTPUT: Recommendation of best machine learning model based on criteria

KEY FEATURES: 	Data Preprocessing 		Model Selection 		Model Evaluation		Metrics	User Interface	Model Persistence Visualizations



STEP 2: ARCHITECTURE RESEARCH AND PLANNING


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: Python

Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Model Selection: Scikit-Learn

Model Evaluation: Scikit-Learn

User Interface: Flask/Django

Model Persistence: Joblib
